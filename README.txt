INTRODUCTION
===================================================================================
This code is provided for research purpose only.
This code performs the boundary detection system based on color-opponent(CO) 
reported in:

    Kaifu Yang, Shaobing Gao, Chaoyi Li, and Yongjie Li*. "Efficient Color Boundary 
    Detection with Color-opponent Mechanisms",CVPR,2013.

Please cite our paper if this code is used to motivate any publications.
===================================================================================
USAGE£º

To detect color boundary with the CO model to an image, 
 run "example.m" for an example.

COBoundary.m is the main function for performing our model.

if you want to apply this algorithm to the BSDS300 dataset, you will need to 
download and install the code for applying benchmark, which is available£º
